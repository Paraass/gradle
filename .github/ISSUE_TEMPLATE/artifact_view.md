## Documentation for ArtifactView

### Overview
The `ArtifactView` is a powerful feature in Gradle that provides a flexible model for resolving artifacts in a project. It allows you to specify different use-cases for artifact resolution, handle common error cases, and control variant reselection.

### Use-Cases
- **Specifying Artifacts**: With `ArtifactView`, you can easily specify artifacts for different variants of your project. For example, you can define custom configurations and attach artifacts to them.
- **Handling Variant Reselection**: Previously, if a dependency with an explicit artifact referenced a variant, upon reselection, the explicit artifact was never reselected. The latest changes update variant reselection to throw an exception in this case, but you can use the lenient artifact view to silence this exception.

### Snippets
```groovy
// Example of specifying an artifact for a variant
configurations {
    myConfiguration
}

artifacts {
    myConfiguration("myArtifactFile.txt") {
        builtBy tasks.myTask
    }
}
```

### Error Cases
- **No Response**: If you encounter any issues with the `ArtifactView` and receive no response from the resolver, please check the Gradle User Manual or seek help from the Gradle community.

### Changes in This Release
- **selectFromAllVariants**: The `selectFromAllVariants` option can now be specified at the time of selection, rather than upon construction of the variant selector. This provides greater flexibility when resolving artifacts.
- **ResovledVariantSet**: The concept of a 'legacy' variant set has been removed from `ResovledVariantSet` and migrated to `VariantResolvingArtifactSet`. This improves the organization and maintainability of the codebase.
- **ResovledArtifactsGraphVisitor and ComponentGraphResolveState**: These implementations have been updated to ensure that variant state objects don't have to 'know' about the variants of their owning component. This simplifies the code and enhances modularity.
- **ArtifactSelector to VeriantArtifactResovle**: The `ArtifactSelector` class has been renamed to `VeriantArtifactResovle` to better align with Gradle's naming conventions.

### How to Use ArtifactView
To leverage the power of `ArtifactView`, follow these steps:

1. Declare the necessary configurations and artifacts in your build script, specifying the artifacts for different variants if needed. Use the provided snippets as a starting point.
2. In case of any issues, refer to the Gradle User Manual or seek assistance from the Gradle community. The Gradle community is a valuable resource for troubleshooting and finding solutions to common problems.
